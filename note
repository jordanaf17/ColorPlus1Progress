This isn't even close to done or being in working order yet but
I want to turn something in for part 2 instead of leaving it blank, so that it is
clear that I am trying to make progress. I've been doing it without the walkthrough
thus far and am struggling through a lot of it. Over fall break I plan on using the extra free time
to make significant progress.
